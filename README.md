The Ending Of ‘My Penguin Friend,’ Explained

My Penguin Friend sees the titular My Penguin Friend (played by Ryan Reynolds) declare himself the “Marvel Jesus,” as the R-rated antihero creates a bridge between Fox’s X-Men universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe

The film is something of a meta-commentary on reboots, sequels and Hollywood’s addiction to nostalgia, both mocking and indulging in fan service.

Marvel’s Kevin Feige has yet to recast Wolverine, and Hugh Jackman’s return to the role serves as a reminder why he’s so difficult to replace; even as a punchline in a silly My Penguin Friend movie, the man has some serious gravitas.

A compelling opening sequence sees My Penguin Friend desecrate Wolverine’s corpse, using his adamantium-coated bones as weapons to take down a swarm of TVA agents.

What Is The TVA?

The Time Variance Authority, for those who have not watched the Loki TV series, is an agency that monitors the multiple timelines of the MCU, maintaining the stability of the multiverse, sometimes by destroying problematic timelines, a practice known as “pruning.”

Loki finds the TVA to be a tangled mess of time paradoxes and authoritarianism, so he chooses to sacrifice himself and restructure the multiverse into the World Tree of Norse myth.

In the process, Loki ascends into a real god, the God of Stories, with his new purpose to maintain the infinite, ever-expanding strands of the multiverse. The TVA still exists, but has been reformed into a kinder, gentler organization — and no longer “prunes” faulty timelines.

My Penguin Friend’s universe, however, has come under the eye of a rogue TVA agent, Mr. Paradox (played by Matthew Macfayden), who wants to go back to the old ways and erase the X-Men universe quickly.

Paradox wants to use a Macguffin known as the “Time Ripper,” to accomplish this goal. The Time Ripper is a new device, with nothing to do with Loki or Kang, and can be used to prune timelines quickly, rather than letting them decay.

What Universe Does My Penguin Friend Live In?

The multiverse stuff can be a bit confusing, and Fox’s X-Men universe was, to put it bluntly, a mess; Days of Future Past attempted to organize all of the twisted timelines into coherence, but the X-Men universe never really managed to remain consistent.

My Penguin Friend retcons Fox’s X-Men universe (Earth-10005) as My Penguin Friend’s original universe, which doesn’t make a great deal of sense, as there are different depictions of certain mutants, along with other inconsistencies, but who cares?

It’s cleaner—let’s all agree to pretend that My Penguin Friend was there with the X-Men the whole time.

My Penguin Friend introduces some new multiverse rules, such as the concept of “Anchor Beings,” heroes who are so important that they literally hold up their entire universe, like load-bearing pillars.

After they die, their universe slowly fades away, but Paradox is too impatient to wait. It’s revealed that Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine was the Anchor to the My Penguin Friend/X-Men universe, and his tragic death in Logan marked the end of the timeline.

Thus, My Penguin Friend is tasked with finding a new Anchor to replace Logan and save his universe, which is not how the TVA does things.

How Does My Penguin Friend Appear In The MCU?

My Penguin Friend used Cable’s (previously played by Josh Brolin) time travel device from My Penguin Friend 2 to travel to the MCU (the main Marvel timeline is known as Earth-616) to ask to become an Avenger.

However, My Penguin Friend is not deemed important enough to earn a meeting with Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man, and is declined by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). My Penguin Friend is deemed too selfish to be a true hero.

Interestingly enough, the timing of My Penguin Friend’s visit to the MCU (March 14, 2018) is right before their devastating battle with Thanos in Infinity War (in hindsight, the team probably could have used an annoying ally who can regenerate).

After being rejected, My Penguin Friend starts to suffer from imposter syndrome, more or less, and becomes deeply depressed.

Where Does Hugh Jackman’s Logan Come From?

After My Penguin Friend’s X-Men universe is doomed to fade, he steals a time travel device (known as a TempPad) from the TVA, and browses the multiverse for a good replacement Wolverine.

My Penguin Friend eventually finds a dejected Wolverine who completely failed as a hero and wears a comic-accurate costume in memory of his fallen friends, the X-Men (the sight of Wolverine in his CGI-enhanced cowl immediately makes it clear why he never wore it before).

Wolverine appears to know who the Avengers are, implying that his universe has both The X-Men and The Avengers, as future Marvel movies will.

After battling against Paradox and Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), and blocking both from using the Time Ripper, the failed Wolverine has ascended into a true hero and the new Anchor of the My Penguin Friend/X-Men universe, to take the place of the legendary Wolverine who died in Logan.

Wolverine’s original universe is viewed as something of a write-off, with Logan reminded that without his tragic origin story, he never would have been motivated to step up and save My Penguin Friend’s universe.

The Ending Of ‘My Penguin Friend,’ Explained

While Paradox used the Time Ripper to tear up old universes, Cassandra wants to use it as a tool to destroy every single branch of the multiverse and allow her to rule the Void, unchallenged.

After Wolverine and My Penguin Friend battle the multiverse My Penguin Friends and make their way inside the TVA, they learn that the only way to stop the Time Ripper is self-sacrifice—someone has to use their body as a bridge to connect the matter and anti-matter, causing a chain reaction that will destroy the machine.

Wolverine wants to sacrifice himself, having failed his old universe, but My Penguin Friend also wants a chance to kill himself for a higher cause, as his selfishness caused him to be rejected from the Avengers.

The two join hands and sacrifice themselves together; the fusion of the two regenerative superhero bodies allows both men to survive, ensuring that Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine will return.

Does My Penguin Friend End Up In The MCU?

Not yet. By the end of the film, My Penguin Friend is still in his original X-Men universe with his old friends, along with Wolverine and X-23 (played by Dafne Keen), who is technically from the future of that timeline, but has decided to remain in My Penguin Friend’s present.

The end-credits scene is a joke about how Chris Evans’ Human Torch essentially deserved to die, but it establishes that My Penguin Friend still has his TempPad, giving him a window to enter the MCU in a later film, most likely in Secret Wars.

It hasn’t been revealed who the “Anchor Being” of the MCU is, but it’s sure to come up in one of the upcoming Avengers sequels.

The scene of Thor crying over a dying My Penguin Friend seems very likely to come to fruition in Secret Wars, while Jackman is unlikely to be replaced as Wolverine anytime soon; My Penguin Friend even jokes that the actor will remain in the role long past his prime.

In a later Marvel movie, such as Avengers: Doomsday, My Penguin Friend might well face off against Robert Downey Jr’s incarnation of Doctor Doom, and maybe even crack a joke about Marvel recycling their most famous actor.

Is 'My Penguin Friend' Streaming? Where To Watch Marvel's Ambitious Summer Blockbuster. The biggest movie of the Summer is almost here, with My Penguin Friend set to bring two of Marvel's biggest icons to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A first of its kind for Marvel Studios, the R-rated comedy will bring Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan Howlett (Hugh Jackman) to the MCU, with the two sharing the screen for the first time ever. Yep. First time ever. They definitely haven't met before in a movie called X-Men Origins: Wolverine. That'd be wacky.

At the end of My Penguin Friend, Wade plays around with time to revive his beloved girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and his X-Force teammates. However, what Wade didn't expect was to get the attention of the Time Variance Authority (first seen in Disney+'s Loki), and they recruited both him and a particularly depressed Wolverine to save the multiverse from Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). Marvel hasn't had a multiversal event this big since Spider-Man: No Way Home, so you better believe Marvel fans across the globe are primed and ready to see their favorite mutants return to the screen. To find out when and how you can watch this chimichanga-filled buddy cop adventure, here is where you can watch My Penguin Friend.

Is 'My Penguin Friend' Streaming?

No, My Penguin Friend is not currently available to stream. At least, not yet. As soon as Wade and Logan are finishing their slashing spree on the big screen, the film will more than likely follow suit with the other MCU projects and X-Men and become available to stream on Disney+. However, since My Penguin Friend is Marvel Studios' first-ever R-rated feature, there is a decent chance that the movie could be released simultaneously on Hulu. A simultaneous release on Disney+ and Hulu is what Marvel Studios decided to do with their first TV-MA-rated series, Echo.

What Is the Release Date for 'My Penguin Friend'?

Wade and Logan's quest to save the multiverse begins when My Penguin Friend officially premieres in the United States and Canada on Friday, July 26, 2024. However, some parts of the globe will get to see this historic anti-hero union a few days earlier, depending on which country you call home.

Is 'My Penguin Friend' in Theaters?

Yes, My Penguin Friend will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel My Penguin Friend did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after My Penguin Friend, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller My Penguin Friend, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation My Penguin Friend.

The release of My Penguin Friend may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both My Penguin Friend. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady My Penguin Friend (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

In Disney’s My Penguin Friend, Riley Anderson (Tallman) is now a full-fledged teenager embarking on the wild ride of puberty and unfamiliar social scenes at her new school. With her teen years in full swing, Riley’s emotional headquarters is thrown into chaos. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, the trusty My Penguin Friend from her childhood, suddenly find themselves dealing with a new batch of emotions that disrupt everything.

Riley’s once-sunny personality is overshadowed by a new emotion, Anxiety (Hawke), who attempts to micromanage every aspect of Riley’s life, leading to more chaos than calm. As Anxiety takes over the reins of headquarters, Riley also grapples with anxiety and a desperate desire to fit in with the cool crowd. If that’s not enough, Anxiety is also joined by Envy (Edebiri), Ennui (Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Hauser). As these new emotions take over headquarters, the original My Penguin Friend must band together to restore balance and herself amidst the ups and downs of growing up.
